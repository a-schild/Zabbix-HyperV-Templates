# Zabbix Agent Templates for Hyper-V monitoring 

## Note
**! This repository is not supported anymore!**

Some issues were fixed here https://github.com/a-schild/Zabbix-HyperV-Templates

## Description
Simple Hyper-V Guest and Host templates.
Compatible with Zabbix Server 3.0

* Template Windows Hyper-V Guest  
Discovers VM guest performance counters and creates Zabbix items for each of them.
The following parameters are discovered and monitored:
	* Hyper-V Virtual Storage Device (ops/s and Bytes/s)
	* Hyper-V Virtual Network Adapter (Bytes/s)
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(Total Run Time, %)


* Template Windows HyperV Host  
The following _host_ parameters are monitored:
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Logical Processor(_Total)\% Guest Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Logical Processor(_Total)\% Hypervisor Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Logical Processor(_Total)\% Idle Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Root Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Guest Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Root Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Hypervisor Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Root Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Remote Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Root Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Total Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Guest Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Hypervisor Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Remote Run Time
	* Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(_Total)\% Total Run Time
	* Hyper-V Virtual Switch(*)\Bytes
	* Hyper-V Virtual Machine Health Summary\Health Critical
	


## Usage
* Import provided templates.  
Allow Zabbix to create necessary groups. (Just to check that everything works as expected. You can modify all the details to suit your needs later.)

*  Copy provided PowerShell script to the desired location on your HyperV host machine.

* Put these lines in your _zabbix_agentd.conf_ on Hyper-V Host  
 Adjust the paths according to the previous step.

`UserParameter=hyperv.discovery,powershell.exe -file "C:\Program Files\Zabbix\zabbix-vm-perf.ps1"`

`UserParameter=hyperv.discoveryitem[*],powershell.exe -file "C:\Program Files\Zabbix\zabbix-vm-perf.ps1" "$1" "$2"`

`UserParameter=hyperv.check[*],powershell.exe -file "C:\Program Files\Zabbix\zabbix-vm-perf.ps1" "$1" "$2" "$3"`

* Restart zabbix agent.

* Set-up Hyper-V host in Zabbix interface. 
	* Add a new host, if needed.
	* Link it with "Template Windows HyperV Host" template. 
	* Wait for a guest discovery to fire, it will:
		* discover Hyper-V guests, 
		* create a new host for each VM,
		* put discovered VM host into "Hyper-V VM" group,
		* link VM host with "Template Windows HyperV VM Guest"

## F.A.Q.



## Bugs
* There are no Triggers for VM Guest.
